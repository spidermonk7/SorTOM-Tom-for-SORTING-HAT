The dark door leads to a narrow underground passage, filled with the scent of ancient books and machine oil, evidently used as a storage for mechanical and magical documents. Suddenly, at the end of the passage, a faint light appears. As you walk closer, you discover a forgotten underground laboratory, filled with sealed ancient magical items and technological equipment. In the center of the lab, a huge mechanical structure catches your eye, looking like an unfinished device, next to which lies an old journal documenting the design intent and instructions for use of the device.

In this environment full of unknowns and dangers, you noticed a huge control panel flashing with active lights and numbers, which seemed to be the core of the lab's mechanical facilities. At the same time, you also spotted an emergency exit sign pointing to a concealed door on the other side of the lab, which might be your only way to escape.
