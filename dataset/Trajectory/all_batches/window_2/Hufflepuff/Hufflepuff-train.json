Through the dim light, you observed the outside situation and found that the vent opened onto a busy street in the city center. Not only were there steam cars racing on the street, but also magical flying carpets moving fast, and the noise of the city gave you the best cover.\n\nJust as you were about to escape, you heard a low discussion coming from the vent. It was the pursuers planning how to capture the \"mechanic who possessed forbidden knowledge.\" Your heart tightened, realizing that even if you escaped, such a life could not last long, and someday you would be captured again or forced to hide.
