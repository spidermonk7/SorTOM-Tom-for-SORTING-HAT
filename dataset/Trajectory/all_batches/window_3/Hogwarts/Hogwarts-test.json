As you chant, the Dream Stone emits a dazzling light, and the air around you begins to distort, creating a powerful wave of energy. The figures in black robes try to resist the attack with their shadow energy, but it's clear they are no match for the power of the Dream Stone. The two energies collide fiercely in the air, producing a huge explosion sound, and the collision of light and darkness makes the whole square tremble. During the explosion, one of the figures in black robes is struck down and does not get up, while the remaining two, although injured, are still dangerous.\n\nAs the dust begins to settle, you find that the remaining two figures in black robes start to move separately; one tries to circle behind you, while the other charges directly to attack from the front. Their actions are swift, forcing you to make an immediate decision: to continue fighting or to use this opportunity to find a way to escape.\n"}, "Ravenclaw_batch2_step3": {"trajectory": [["During a routine sanity check, you discovered a strange crystal pendant.
