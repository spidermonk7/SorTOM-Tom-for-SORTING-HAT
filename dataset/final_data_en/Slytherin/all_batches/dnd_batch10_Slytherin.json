As you hold it, two opposing forces intertwine within you, your shadow begins to twist uncontrollably, and mysterious patterns of light and shadow emerge on your arm.

Unknown whispers echo in your mind, seemingly guiding you. Away from the noise of the blessing ceremony, you come to the old part of the city, dark and run-down, but relatively safe. You find an abandoned hut to take shelter and try to clear your thoughts. Just then, a ragged old woman appears at the door, her eyes revealing a mysterious sense of knowing everything. She claims to be a former priestess of the Temple of Light, exiled by the Shadow Council for a long time, and now seeks your help to rescue her grandson imprisoned by the council.
