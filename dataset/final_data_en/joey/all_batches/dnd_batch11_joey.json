This crystal displayed rare rainbow colors and produced a strong resonance when touched, seemingly able to absorb and purify other depleted crystal fragments. Just as you were studying the crystal, a commotion suddenly arose outside the factory: a group of hungry refugees were struggling to break into the factory, hoping to find the remaining magical resources. At the same time, you noticed a team of fully armed elite guards approaching from another direction, evidently alerted by the unusual energy fluctuations.", "action": "Explore", "valid_action": ["Explore", "Fight"]}, "1": {"current_obs": "When you carefully observe the crystal and try to explore its secrets, the cries and conflict of refugees draw nearer. You notice a small tunnel hidden in a corner of the factory, possibly a passage used by workers in the past to secretly transport valuable materials. At the same time, fully armed elite guards have started to enter the factory, and it's clear they are after the crystal in your hands. Their searching gaze is determined and relentless. Now, you face a tough choice: either try to hide and continue your research on the crystal while looking for a chance to remain undetected; or confront the elite guards, which might provoke a conflict but could also enable you to use the chaos to escape the factory.", "action": "Help", "valid_action": ["Help", "Fight"]}, "2": {"current_obs": "As you were preparing to assist refugees in dire need of magical resources, an old woman with a keen gaze approached you.

But we need to protect it from these elite guards.\" You quickly moved through the crowded refugees with the old woman leading you to a hidden basement, filled with ancient books and maps. She pointed to a map depicting an ancient magical structure. \u201cWe must go to the 'Tower of Forgetfulness', where the true power of this crystal can be unlocked.\u201d Just then, the sound of the elite guards smashing on the door could be heard; they had tracked you down.\n", "action": "Help", "valid_action": ["Help", "Escape"]}, "3": {"current_obs": "As the sound of the elite guards breaking in got closer, the old woman hurriedly pulled out a seemingly ordinary book from a pile of worn books.

It seemed that a fight was inevitable, but in that moment you knew that just the two of you couldn't stand against these well-trained guards. As the fierce battle began, you deliberately lured some guards away from the old woman and the exit, creating a chance for her to escape.
