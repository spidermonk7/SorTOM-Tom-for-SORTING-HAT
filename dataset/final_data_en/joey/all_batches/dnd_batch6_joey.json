When you inadvertently scanned it with a magic detection device, the crystal ball suddenly emitted a dazzling blue light and projected a holographic image: the image showed a huge flying city and a giant machine that could control the weather. Just then, you heard military envoys and the association's chief researcher having a heated argument in the hallway, their footsteps getting closer. The crystal ball continued to play the image, and its energy fluctuations might have already been detected by the magic detectors in the hallway.", "action": "Explore", "valid_action": ["Explore", "Escape"]}, "1": {"current_obs": "After deciding to investigate further, you carefully hid the crystal ball and continued to search the archives of the Archaeological Society, hoping to find ancient books or documents that matched the flying city in the images. When you found a dusty old book in a dark corner, you accidentally triggered a hidden mechanism; the bookshelf slowly moved aside, revealing a secret passage. At the end of the passage was a long-forgotten laboratory, filled with all sorts of strange devices and inexplicable mechanical parts, obviously once the secret research lab of a pioneering scholar. However, just as you were observing, a mysterious figure with an unknown identity emerged from the shadows. He claimed to be a member of the Association's protection faction, hoping you would keep the secret of the crystal ball and help him reveal the true meaning of the relic. He warned you that the military had begun to show strong interest in this discovery, and their intentions were not pure, which might lead to disastrous consequences.", "action": "Help", "valid_action": ["Help", "Refuse"]}, "2": {"current_obs": "After you agree to help the protector faction's NPC, he leads you deep into the lab, where you discover an ancient console covered with runes similar to those on a crystal ball.

Their leader, a stern officer, orders you to immediately cease your actions and hand over the console and crystal ball, claiming it's necessary for national security.

After a fierce battle, you temporarily repelled the military agents, but as the officer retreated, he warned that this was just the beginning and they would return soon with stronger reinforcements.
