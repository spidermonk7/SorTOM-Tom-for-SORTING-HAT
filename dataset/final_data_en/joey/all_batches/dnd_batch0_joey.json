You discover that the symbols on the parchment are part of an ancient protective spell, and the numeric sequence is some kind of mechanical activation code. This document clearly involves the secret plans of the Mechanical Empire, utilizing ancient magic to enhance their weapons.\n\nWhen you are alone studying the document at night, a woman dressed in steampunk style suddenly enters your view. She identifies herself as an officer on a secret mission for the kingdom, urgently explaining to you that the kingdom's secret service is tracking a spy gang from the Mechanical Empire.
