Suddenly, a masked thief bumps into you, hands you a cloth bag in the confusion, and disappears into the crowd. Opening the cloth bag, you discover an ancient double-sided amulet, one side embedded with a light crystal and the other with a shadow gem. As you hold it, two opposing forces intertwine within you, your shadow begins to twist uncontrollably, and mysterious patterns of light and shadow emerge on your arm.

You barely dodge it and feel the painful burn as the energy grazes you. The surroundings start to warp and change, as if the fight between you two has touched some forbidden power. You realize this fight is not just a physical confrontation but also a clash of magical energies. The warning of the dark energy invasion makes you very concerned.
