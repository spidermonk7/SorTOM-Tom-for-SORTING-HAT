The moment you touched it, memories of gods falling flooded into your mind: you saw an earth-shattering battle between old and new gods, and felt the last divine power of a falling ancient god sealed within this crystal. At that moment, two distinctly different energy fluctuations came from afar: one full of vitality and hope, from an emissary of the newly ascended goddess of life; the other deep and mysterious, from the deity who governs death and rebirth. Clearly, both had sensed this crystal containing ancient divine power.", "action": "Explore", "valid_action": ["Explore", "Escape"]}, "1": {"current_obs": "While investigating the power of ancient deity crystals, you arrived at a nearby village, hoping to get more information from the locals. After asking around, you found an elderly fortune-teller who had witnessed the last disaster when gods clashed. The fortune-teller told you that the crystal not only contains great power but is also key in the struggle between old and new deities. While you were talking, suddenly a mysterious masked person with several men in black rushed into the village. Their target was clearly the crystal in your hands. The masked person claimed to be the messenger of the god of shadows and demanded that you hand over the crystal immediately in exchange for your and the village\u2019s safety.

After a series of struggles, you manage to fend off several men in black, but the masked man is very powerful; his dark magic puts you under great pressure. At this critical moment of life and death, the messenger of the goddess of life suddenly appears. She holds a holy sword of light and lends you a hand in the battle against the shadow messenger.

On the way to the temple, Aria shared more about the doctrine and goals of the Goddess of Life, stating that the Goddess is committed to protecting and nurturing life and opposing the forces of destruction and death. Upon arriving at the temple, she asked for your help in interrogating the Shadow Messenger to learn more about the plans of the God of Shadows and why they are eager to seize the divine crystal.

Aria stated that if this power is misused, it could have devastating consequences for the ecological balance of the whole world. During the discussion, the shadow messenger suddenly broke free and tried to escape to take back the crystal, but was promptly stopped by the guards present.

Darkness spread rapidly, and it seemed like all the light was being devoured.
