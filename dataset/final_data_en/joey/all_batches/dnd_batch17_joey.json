The library is scattered with nightmare records and research reports from around the world, looking as if some scholar had tried to unravel the secrets of the nightmare phenomenon. Inside a secret room of the library, you find an ancient, dusty book titled \"The Gates Between Dreams and Reality.\" This book details how to use the Stone of Dreams to open and stabilize the passage between nightmares and reality, but it also warns of its potential dangers.
