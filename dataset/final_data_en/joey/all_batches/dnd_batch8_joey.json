Just as you were about to start a fire to keep warm, lightning struck the temple's lightning rod, sending the current along the old metal conductor underground. Suddenly, the temple floor cracked open, revealing a glowing crystal ball. When you accidentally touched it, a warm current surged into your body, and you found that you could see magical traces flowing in the air. At the same time, you heard wolves howling in the distance.

You hid in the shadows of the jungle, carefully observing the surroundings, avoiding direct contact with the pack of magical wolves. As you approached, you found that the old hunter's cabin was surrounded by a circle of purple magical barriers, and the old hunter seemed unable to leave the house on his own. The wolves were quietly pacing around the barrier, seemingly looking for an entrance. You noticed the occasionally flickering patterns on the barrier, which seemed to reveal its weak points. At this moment, you couldn't help but wonder whether to continue using your newly acquired powers to try to break the magical barrier and rescue the old hunter, or to find a safe opportunity to retreat and seek more help.", "action": "Help", "valid_action": ["Help", "Escape"]}, "2": {"current_obs": "With your newly acquired power, you try to break the purple magical barrier around the old hunter's cabin.

The barrier starts to dissolve, and the old hunter runs out of the cabin, his expression filled with surprise and gratitude. \"My God, you saved me!\" he says, breathing heavily. However, just as you prepare to leave, purple magical traces quickly spread, and a man in a black robe approaches from deep within the forest. He looks at you coldly and says, \"I did not want outsiders to interfere.\" A purple flame rises in the hands of the mysterious man, clearly indicating he has no peaceful intentions.

The collision of magical energies creates a huge shockwave, shaking the trees in the forest, and even uprooting some smaller trees. After the shock, you see that the black-robed mage has not backed down; he starts chanting a more complex spell, and the air fills with a dangerous aura.

You quickly gathered the magical energy around you to form a stronger shield, urgently blocking this strike. With the sound of explosions, trees were uprooted and leaves fell like rain. After the dust settled, you noticed that the wizard had used up a lot of his magic power and was in a weakened state.
