When you installed it in the machine, something amazing happened: the machine not only started working but also produced a magical phenomenon. At that moment, you noticed a string of mysterious text carved on the core, apparently research notes left by some ancient mage. Suddenly, alarms went off, and inspection teams from the Magic Council and the Mechanic's Guild were approaching your workshop from two directions.

The witch coldly scanned the room, while the engineer's gaze fell directly on the device you had just hidden.\n\n\"We sensed an unusual energy fluctuation,\" the witch said decisively. \"Are you conducting forbidden experiments combining magic and technology?\"\n\nThe engineer, looking around at the machinery and showing his disapproval, said, \"Do you know you are playing with fire? These experiments could get you wanted by both sides.\"\n\nYou knew in your heart that the combination of these powers was the trend of the future, but the current pressure from both sides forced you to be careful.

It turns out that the combination of such powers had long been considered taboo, as it once led to the demise of a powerful mage and a mechanic. As you investigated further, hurried footsteps soon came from outside the door.
