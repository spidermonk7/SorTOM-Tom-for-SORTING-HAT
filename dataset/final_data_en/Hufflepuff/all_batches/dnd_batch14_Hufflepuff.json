Just as you try to catch your breath, an elderly man in a black robe accidentally walks into your hiding spot.

While exploring the chamber, a gust of wind suddenly swept up the map, revealing a hidden door. As you approached this mysterious door, you heard voices inside, as if someone was having an urgent conversation. You pressed your ear against the door and heard two voices discussing how to use the knowledge from the Book of Fate to prevent the coming disaster. One voice belonged to the chief seer, who was trying to persuade the other, a new and powerful seer whom you had never met before, to join her plan.

The chief prophet shared her plan, aiming to use the power of the Book of Fate to develop a strategy to resist the impending disaster, while Serrados insisted that the disaster should be allowed to happen to promote the rebirth of the world.
