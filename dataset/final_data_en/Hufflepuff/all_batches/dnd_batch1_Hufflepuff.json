The moment you touched the pendant, a cold chill pierced your body, and you saw a terrifying sight: huge tentacles bursting from the ground, and darkness swallowing the city.

Suddenly, he stopped and walked directly towards your hiding spot behind the curtains. Just as he was about to pull back the curtain, a hand firmly grabbed his shoulder and dragged him away from the area. It was another person, a stronger-looking guard in armor.
