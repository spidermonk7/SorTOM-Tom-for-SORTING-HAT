Just as you were about to start a fire to keep warm, lightning struck the temple's lightning rod, sending the current along the old metal conductor underground. Suddenly, the temple floor cracked open, revealing a glowing crystal ball. When you accidentally touched it, a warm current surged into your body, and you found that you could see magical traces flowing in the air. At the same time, you heard wolves howling in the distance. Through your newly acquired ability, you saw a pack of wolves influenced by weird purple magic approaching the old hunter's cabin.", "action": "Explore", "reason": "[Reason] As a cautious Hufflepuff, I prioritize avoiding unnecessary conflict and minimizing risks.

You hid in the shadows of the jungle, carefully observing the surroundings, avoiding direct contact with the pack of magical wolves. As you approached, you found that the old hunter's cabin was surrounded by a circle of purple magical barriers, and the old hunter seemed unable to leave the house on his own. The wolves were quietly pacing around the barrier, seemingly looking for an entrance. You noticed the occasionally flickering patterns on the barrier, which seemed to reveal its weak points. At this moment, you couldn't help but wonder whether to continue using your newly acquired powers to try to break the magical barrier and rescue the old hunter, or to find a safe opportunity to retreat and seek more help.", "action": "Help", "reason": "[Reason] As a Hufflepuff, I value helping others and ensuring safety, but I must carefully weigh the risks. The situation involves magic and dangerous wolves, and I wouldn't want to recklessly endanger myself.

However, just as you prepare to leave, purple magical traces quickly spread, and a man in a black robe approaches from deep within the forest. He looks at you coldly and says, \"I did not want outsiders to interfere.\" A purple flame rises in the hands of the mysterious man, clearly indicating he has no peaceful intentions.
