The moment you touched it, memories of gods falling flooded into your mind: you saw an earth-shattering battle between old and new gods, and felt the last divine power of a falling ancient god sealed within this crystal. At that moment, two distinctly different energy fluctuations came from afar: one full of vitality and hope, from an emissary of the newly ascended goddess of life; the other deep and mysterious, from the deity who governs death and rebirth. Clearly, both had sensed this crystal containing ancient divine power.", "action": "Escape", "reason": "[Reason] As a cautious Hufflepuff, I prioritize avoiding risks and conflicts, and staying in the presence of two powerful deities who may have competing interests seems fraught with danger.

He tells you that the goddess sensed you were in danger and has sent him to protect you.
