Turning around, a shadowy creature is standing quietly at the door, its gaze piercing towards you like a cold knife, seemingly waiting for your reaction.", "action": "Escape", "reason": "[Reason] I need to gather more information and resources to better understand and navigate the nightmare phenomenon, and engaging in a needless fight could be dangerous and unwise without sufficient preparation, ", "valid_action": ["Fight", "Escape"]}, "2": {"current_obs": "After escaping from the library, you struggle forward in the menacing darkness, filled with fear and unease.
