Just then, a squad of the Flame Church's guards, who patrol for heretics, happens to pass by your house. They seem to sense an unusual elemental fluctuation.

You ran into a dense forest protected by the Church of Natural Elements. Here, the air was filled with the scent of earth and life, which made the elemental senses in your body exceptionally active. Just as you were catching your breath under a tree and trying to calm down, a monk from the Church of Nature discovered you. He was dressed in a green robe, with a kind look in his eyes, contrasting sharply with the stiff seriousness of the Flame Church. Your heart raced, feeling that this could either be an opportunity or a trap. The monk seemed very interested in the fluctuations of your elements.

What are you escaping from?\" At this sensitive moment, you pondered how to respond.", "action": "Help", "reason": "[Reason] I must carefully consider whether to trust the monk or not.

To verify this, he suggested taking you to meet the elders of the Natural Church for more guidance and protection. However, he also warned you that this path would be very dangerous, as not only the Fire Church, but other elemental powers might also take an interest in you.
