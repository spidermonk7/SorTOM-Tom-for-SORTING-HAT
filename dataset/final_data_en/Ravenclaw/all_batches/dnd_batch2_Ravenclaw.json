He offers to help you uncover its secrets. However, a sudden alarm bell from outside interrupts your conversation, as the \"Dark Tide Hunters\" have expanded their search area and started to search the library.

However, just as you are discussing how to use this compass to reach the Deep Sea Temple, a knock at the door interrupts your conversation. Through the attic window, you see several unidentified armed individuals knocking. They are dressed differently from the \"Dark Tide Hunters,\" appearing more secretive and dangerous.
